# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
The Spotify API is used to take the user's top artists. Then, the Musicbrainz API generates generates the country, genres, or birthdates of the artists. If the artist is a group, for example, BTS, instead of the birthdate of all the members, the debut date of the group is given.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
This program is not ideal if you do not use Spotify since Spotify won't have the information of your top artists.

## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
I need your email to your Spotify account so that I can add it to the Spotify API's usesr access. Otherwise, Spotify does not have permission to view the user's Spotify information. If you do not have Spotify, I will happily give you my Spotify account information.
